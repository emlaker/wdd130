        [The views that you get mountain biking are unparalelled. Mountain Biking is a passion of mine ever since I was a kid. I loved the thrill of riding while enjoying the great outdoors. This is your one-stop shop for all things mountain biking: a community page for discussing trails and ideas, and a place for renting bikes and gear! This site is mean to help people connect, and get people outdoors together.]

      <h3>[Community Page]</h3>
      <p>
        [Growing up a lot of my friends didn't like to mountain bike, and in a place like Las Vegas I didn't blame them. I usually just went with my family, but I also wish that there was a place I could turn to for friends that shared my passion. Finding fellow mountain bikers can be tough which is why I decided to make this community page! This is a place where people can chat about the latest trails they've gone on, or ask for advice on trails they would like to go on. Below is a link to the community Facebook page where everyone can go to connect. Make sure that you are kind and respectful to others in your posts and comments.]

      <h3>[MTB Rentals]</h3>
      <p>
        [When it comes to mountain biking there are several different styles, and each one serves a unique purpose. Just like tools you need the right one for the job! Here we have a nice mix of full suspension and hard-tail bikes, disk brakes and v-brakes, and regular or grip-shift. I know that there is a lot to take in, especially if you are new, so that is why we offer the ability to chat with an employee to explain what each feature bring to the table! Below you will find a series of pictures of mountain bikes with each of these features, along with their prices. We want to make sure that you pick the right one for you, so please make sure to contact us. We love to help and want to make sure you have an amazing experience outdoors, which is why we also offer guided tours of different trails in the area for those of you who are new to the area or Mountain Biking in general. Below are different ways to reach out to us, and we are looking forward to hearing from you!]
