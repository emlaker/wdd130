        Growing up a lot of my friends didn't like to mountain bike, and in a place like Las Vegas I didn't blame them. I usually just went with my family, but I also wish that there was a place I could turn to for friends that shared my passion. Finding fellow mountain bikers can be tough which is why I decided to make this community page! This is a place where people can chat about the latest trails they've gone on, or ask for advice on trails they would like to go on. Below is a link to the community Facebook page where everyone can go to connect. Make sure that you are kind and respectful to others in your posts and comments.
