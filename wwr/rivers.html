                    Although rafting is really fun and full of adventure it is important to realize that there are some risks involved. In the areas where we raft there are certain wildlife that are not so very friendly, like the rattler shown on the left. Spiders and snakes in these desert regions can be very deadly and you should exercise caution and good judgement. There is also risks of being capsized while rafting, especially on the harder rivers. As was stated earlier, our crew are saftey certified and following their guide should keep you safe from harm.
